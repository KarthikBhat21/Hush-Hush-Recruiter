# Hush-Hush-Recruiter.

1. Candidates data extraction from REST APIs and Web Scraping from websites such as GitHub and Stack Overflow.

2. Data Preprocessing (Cleaning and Transformation) of the data.

3. Developing a user interface with Python's 'tkinter' library that enables hiring managers to select the desired skill when considering candidates for a potential role.

4. Applying machine learning (Logistic Regression) on the data which would select the best candidates for the potential role. The selected candidates will be sent an automated email which contains a link which would redirect them to the coding interface for further assessment in the recruitment process.
